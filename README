DESCRIPTION

system which handles basic automatically command line arguments like -? or --help. Parsed
command line arguments can be directed to member fields by annotations. Also, arguments can
have constraints like minValue, maxValue or value ranges etc. and for defined constraints
informative help text fragments are generated automatically.
